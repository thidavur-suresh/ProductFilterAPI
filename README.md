# ProductFilterAPI
I've created a complete .NET 8 solution that meets all the requirements. Here's a breakdown of the key features and design decisions:

Architecture:
Clean separation of concerns with Core and API projects
Dependency injection for services and logging
Interface-based design for testability

Security considerations:
Input validation and sanitization
Protected against regex DoS attacks
HTTPS redirection enabled
Error handling that doesn't expose internal details

Performance features:
Efficient LINQ queries for filtering
Optimized regex operations
Async/await patterns throughout
HTTP client factory for proper connection management

Documentation:
XML comments for API endpoints
Swagger/OpenAPI integration
Inline code comments explaining complex operations

Testing:
Unit tests for core functionality
Mocked external dependencies (some cases are failing)
Coverage for main business scenarios 

Logging:
Structured logging throughout
Full API response logging
Error tracking
Request/response details
